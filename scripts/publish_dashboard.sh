# Build the read-only dashboard snapshot — a self-contained static SPA bundle
# (every investigation + study + assets) that anyone can browse with no server.
# Built by `vivarium-workbench-publish`; the same build is used locally (to
# preview) and by .github/workflows/publish-dashboard.yml (to publish to
# gh-pages:dashboard/).
#
# GENERIC: base-path + interactive-url are passed in (the CI workflow derives
# them from the GitHub repo), so this script is workspace-agnostic — it ships
# with every workspace scaffolded from the template, no per-repo edits.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/publish_dashboard.sh [OUT_DIR] [BASE_PATH] [INTERACTIVE_URL]
#     OUT_DIR          default: reports/published/dashboard
#     BASE_PATH        e.g. /<repo>/dashboard for GitHub Pages' project subpath
#                      (omit for a root-served bundle)
#     INTERACTIVE_URL  link back to the live/interactive repo (optional)
#
# Preview locally (no base-path → served at the root):
#   scripts/publish_dashboard.sh /tmp/dash
#   python -m http.server -d /tmp/dash 8080   # -> http://localhost:8080/
#
# Needs `vivarium-workbench-publish` on PATH (run via the workspace .venv, or
# `uv run`).
